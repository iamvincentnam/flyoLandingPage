# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page



## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This landing page project challenge is a very popular one. I've seen over 4 youtube projects of this from different tech vlogers.
In My attempt to salvage my skill in front end(exploring the almost infinite awsomeness of flexbox & Responsive design)
I jumped on this challenge. 
The aim is not to make a landing page of your choice with conveninece, but the aim is to make a clone of  the design template  by Developing it. this challenge helped me improve in my coding skills by building realistic projects.
